## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User signs up or logs in** via Firebase Authentication.
2. **Profile is created or fetched** from Firestore.
3. A **vCard (.vcf)** is generated and converted into a **QR code**.
4. **Others scan your QR** to instantly get your contact and add it to their phone.
5. **Offline mode** caches your card and scan page for fast access.
6. To **update your profile**, internet access is required.
